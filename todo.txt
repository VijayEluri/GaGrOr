=========================================
TODO list in order of decreasing priority
=========================================

User functionality: Verify password when registering. Log in and change password.
Proper exception handling (specific, service-technology-neutral exceptions as superclasses of EJB exceptions).

Use abstract type for enums, defining integer code (with Hibernate type mapping) and display text

Implement hashCode, equals, and toString methods for entities properly

Add Spring TLD, using JSP fragments for tag definitions

Remove Message entity, Welcome controller etc.

Add more framework unit tests (and in the future, write new tests when adding functionality)

Clean up pom.xml, define properties for all versions, sort for readability, add more information

Add Hibernate lifecycle interceptor, use to store entity changes and to check editing permissions

Set cookie with session handle when logging in. Use it in place of login if session times out

Refactor JSP pages for CSS use and add CSS file

Further description of project purpose and technologies in README file

=====================================
Ideas, not yet decided or prioritized
=====================================

User-User relationship either mapped twice (friends, friendsOf) or stored in strict ID order (ID1 < ID2). Needs decision

Better solution (investigate how) for how to access persistence_2_0.xsd in correct location

Enable cacheing of entities using @Cacheable annotation (needs study)

Create parallell DTO and entity classes, since EJB will detach entities it should return DTOs. Or, alternatively, use entity class as DTO as well.
Another option is to return detached entity object, but make sure that all data needed by the view layer has been fetched (to prevent lazy fetching
from causing exceptions when attempted on the detached entities).

==============
Rejected ideas
==============

Use embeddable data types instead of plain Java types in mappings. View layer responsible for input parsing. Rejected since there is not enough
freedom in how embeddable types can be used. An @Embeddable type cannot inherit from another @Embeddable type, and @GeneratedValue cannot be used
on @EmbeddedId. Might still be possible if ID types are custom created, could be investigated in the future.
