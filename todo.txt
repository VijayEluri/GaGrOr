Add Hibernate validator

Add Hibernate lifecycle interceptor, use to store entity changes and to check editing permissions

Add more framework unit tests when framework is stable

Remove Message entity, Welcome controller etc. when other functionality has been added.

Use embeddable data types instead of plain Java types in mappings. View layer responsible for input parsing

Enable cacheing of entities using @Cacheable annotation (needs study)

Create parallell DTO and entity classes, since EJB will detach entities it should return DTOs

Use abstract type for enums, defining integer code (with Hibernate type mapping) and display text

Create user entity. Store username and password in session when logging in

Set cookie with session handle when logging in. Use it in place of login if session times out

Sort TODO list in priority order

======================
Ideas, not yet decided
======================

Create service factory in service package, move all service interfaces there. This would hide service
technology choice from view layer.

User-User relationship either mapped twice (friends, friendsOf) or stored in strict ID order (ID1 < ID2)

Better solution (investigate how) for how to access persistence_2_0.xsd in correct location
